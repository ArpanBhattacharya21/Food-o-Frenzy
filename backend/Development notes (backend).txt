Some commands needs to be modified as per my research:

-> To create package.json file:
            npm init
            
-> TO start nodemon:
                npx nodemon .\index.js
            instead of nodemon .\index.js

-> Remove '/' from /node_modules in .gitignore file
-> npm install express nodemon mongoose
